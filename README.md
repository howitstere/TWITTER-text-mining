Text Mining on Twitter data: an analysis about Italian politicians' behaviours in 2021

The aim of this work is to compare the way Italian politicians use their Twitter
accounts, with a particular focus on the kind of the tweet and on the political wing
that a particular user represents. Indeed, since it is a wide-ranging topic, this work
will dwell only on some crucial points, among these, how the selected users behave
differently on Twitter. For example, paying attention to the several strategies that
the accounts could implement in order to increase their visibility. For this reason,
several indicators of appreciation will be observed and used to compare the
different profiles. Since Twitter can provide a huge amount of data, the extraction
of useful information cannot be carried out solely by human mind but requires text
mining.
