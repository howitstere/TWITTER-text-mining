Text Mining on Twitter data: an analysis about Italian politicians' behaviours in 2021

 Abstract
The aim of this work is to compare the way Italian politicians use their Twitter
accounts, with a particular focus on the kind of the tweet and on the political wing
that a particular user represents. Indeed, since it is a wide-ranging topic, this work
will dwell only on some crucial points, among these, how the selected users behave
differently on Twitter. For example, paying attention to the several strategies that
the accounts could implement in order to increase their visibility. For this reason,
several indicators of appreciation will be observed and used to compare the
different profiles. Since Twitter can provide a huge amount of data, the extraction
of useful information cannot be carried out solely by human mind but requires text
mining.


 Limitations
Text mining is a useful process but, of course, has many limitations, as a matter of fact, it does not
reveal an absolute truth contained within the text. Namely, as an average reduces information for
consumption of a large set of numbers, text mining reduces information too.
It is a process that offers many costs and time-efficiency advantages over older techniques, it is fast
and allows a wider reach, without being extremely expensive. Still the risk of collecting false or
garbled results is high, due to badly performed collection of data, but also because of high levels
of anonymity and privacy. Indeed, particularly when using social media data, the information
collected could have been manipulated, and above all, it is not certain that it does reflect the actual
behavior of people.
Moreover, the pre-processing stage requires care and attention and specific tools, in order to
prepare the text to be analyzed. Indeed, depending on the aim of the analysis, the pre-processing
steps will be different and need to be performed and checked several times, often involving
manually examination of the text under study.
Despite the technological improvements gained in the past years, the text represents expression and
is necessarily impacted by the audience perception. Moreover, language continues to evolve and
the way it is used, as well as word choice, changes constantly. Although text mining is an attempt
to hit a moving target as language evolve, it is considered as one of the areas of data science that is
as difficult as challenging.


 Conclusions
Given a data bank composed by a collection of tweets, regarding a sample of the more active Italian
politicians on Twitter, an introductory analysis concerning several features of these accounts has
been performed in order to get an overview as detailed and complete as possible. The objects under
study included number of followers, and different types of interactions (Retweets, Favorites,
Hashtags, Quotes and Mentions). The information collected has made it possible to observe what
the users have in common and which content differentiate one user from the other, highlighting
their uniqueness. In this part of the analysis, the selected users seem to be completely different
between each other, in terms of visibility and behaviors, although some of them seem to
implement a similar strategy, in particular for hashtags.
A more detailed and deeper analysis has been performed implementing Text Mining and examining
the use of the words contained in the tweets. This process has allowed to consider just those words
which are useful in order to collect information. It turned out that the differences observed in the
first part of the analysis were just superficial. Indeed, the users ended up showing similar
behaviors and implementing almost identical strategies, which is curious given that they represent
opposite political wings and therefore should have completely different point of views.
All considered, these two-analysis combined allow to get an idea about the visibility to which most
Italian politicians are subjected, but above all, how they use a social platform like Twitter to carry
on their ideas, representing Italian citizens.
